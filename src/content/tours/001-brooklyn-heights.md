## About the Tour

This ~2 hour tour focuses on the lives of three women who lived in Brooklyn Heights during the years the Brooklyn Bridge was being built (1869-1883). We cover gender dynamics, fashion, real estate, and politics, with a healthy dose of scandal. It starts in Cadman Plaza and ends on the Brooklyn Heights Promenade.

As seen on NBC's New York Live!
