## About the Tour

Hop aboard a vintage trolley as we sip through Brooklyn's boozy history -- from the Brooklyn Whiskey Wars to the golden age of Brooklyn beer brewing in the 19th century. The tour also covers 19th century bar culture, Prohibition, the Brooklyn Dodgers, the Ice Scandal of 1900, and more.

With a trivia game sponsored by...

*   Schaefer’s Beer, the one beer to have when you’re having more than one.
    
*   Excelsior Brewing Co, makers of King’s Beer and King’s Ale, the first New York City Brew packed in Cans.
    
*   Huber’s O-H Extract of Malt. “The mother should never grow old to her children. O-H extract of malt helps her keep young by giving her restful sleep, quiet nerves, and good digestion."
    

And more!

This tour is only open to groups because we have to rent a trolley. Email tours@arielazoff.com if you'd like to set one up.
