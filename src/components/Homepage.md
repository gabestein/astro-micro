An assimilated Brooklynite, I'm a certified NYC Sightseeing Guide and in my spare time I design and lead women's history tours of the city.

My goal with these tours is to show a different side of famous New York neighborhoods -- to give tour goers a snapshot into what life was like in different periods of history for the people that we don't often learn about in school, and through that, to examine larger movements and trends that are still impacting the way we live today.

I also like to have fun, involve my groups in the storytelling, and drudge up some scandal and intrigue along the way (these tours are PG-13!).

Currently on offer: [In the Shadow of the Great Bridge (19th Century Brooklyn Heights)](/tours/001-brooklyn-heights) and [Radical Women of the 1910s (East Village)](/tours/002-radical-1910s).
