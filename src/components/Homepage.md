An assimilated Brooklynite, I'm a certified NYC Sightseeing Guide and in my spare time I design and lead specialized walking tours of the city.

My tours show a different side of famous New York neighborhoods, giving you a snapshot into what life was like in different periods of history for the people that didn't make it into the history books. They also include a healthy dose scandal and intrigue to keep things interesting (these tours are PG-13!).

Currently on offer: [In the Shadow of the Great Bridge (19th Century Brooklyn Heights)](/tours/001-brooklyn-heights) and [Radical Women of the 1910s (East Village)](/tours/002-radical-1910s).
