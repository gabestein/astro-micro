An assimilated Brooklynite, I'm a certified NYC Sightseeing Guide and in my
spare time I design and lead women's history tours of the city. Currently on
offer: <a href="/tours/001-brooklyn-heights">late 19th century Brooklyn Heights</a> and <a href="/tours/002-radical-1910s">East Village in the 1910s</a>.

When I'm not giving tours, I head up Atlas Obscura's tourism industry
partnerships, bringing my professional media experience and personal passion
for travel and sustainability to the role.
