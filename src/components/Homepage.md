An assimilated Brooklynite, I'm a certified NYC Sightseeing Guide and in my
spare time I design and lead women's history tours of the city. Currently on
offer: [late 19th century Brooklyn Heights](/tours/001-brooklyn-heights) and [East Village in the 1910s](/tours/002-radical-1910s).

When I'm not giving tours, I head up Atlas Obscura's tourism industry
partnerships, bringing my professional media experience and personal passion
for travel and sustainability to the role.
