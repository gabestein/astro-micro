An assimilated Brooklynite, I'm a certified NYC Sightseeing Guide and in my spare time I design and leads women's history tours of the city. Currently on offer: late 19th century Brooklyn Heights and East Village in the 1910s.

When I'm not giving tours, I head up Atlas Obscura's tourism industry partnerships, bringing my professional media experience and personal passion for travel and sustainability to the role.
